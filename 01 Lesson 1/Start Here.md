#html element
The <html> HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element. There can be only one <html> element in a document.

#Head element
The <head> HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets. There can be only one <head> element in an HTML document.

#Body
The <body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.

#H1-H6
The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest. By default, all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.
